        <p class="text-lg text-text-medium leading-relaxed">Kelly is a trained Holistic Therapist with 26 years of experience working 1-1 with clients. With a gift for warmth and empathy, she brings together therapeutic skills and natural kindness to support seniors in feeling grounded, calm, and cherished.</p>
        
        <p class="text-lg text-text-medium leading-relaxed">She is especially gifted with clients who may be anxious, withdrawn, or dealing with dementia, using intuitive touch and gentle energy to create comfort and connection. Families receive a brief follow-up after each visit, so they're always in the loop and feel reassured their loved one is truly being cared for.</p>

          We didn't realise how much Mum needed this until we saw her smile after Kelly's visit. It's not just care. It's kindness, dignity and soul.
