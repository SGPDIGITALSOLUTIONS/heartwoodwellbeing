          <p class="mb-4">Hello, my name is Kelly, and I'm a Bespoke Senior Companion. I provide comforting holistic care tailored to each individual's needs â€“ including massage, aromatherapy, sound therapy and of course meaningful conversation. My goal is to support well-being through connection, comfort and compassion.</p>
          
          <p class="mb-4">I am a trained Holistic Therapist with 26 years of experience working 1-1 with clients. Offering warmth and empathy, I bring together therapeutic skills and natural kindness to support seniors in feeling grounded, calm and heard.</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-text-medium leading-relaxed">I have been working in the care home environment for the past year and have references to provide from Carers, Residents and Care home managers. I pride myself in the regular positive feedback I receive daily.</p>

          My Dad has recently moved into a nursing home in Brampton. Kelly has visited my Dad (especially whilst I was away on holiday and unable to visit him personally) on a fairly regular basis since he arrived. She has checked in on his wellbeing, had various chats with him, and played him some lovely tibetan bowls which is great for relaxation. He even commented on how he enjoyed the experience. Kelly routinely updates me at the end of her visits, lets me know how Dad is, any anecdotes or other nuggets that she feels I should know about. I have personal experience of Kelly's great abilities as a massage therapist, and think it's wonderful that she is now taking her skills into nursing and care homes too. ðŸ˜Š

          Kelly has been giving neck, shoulder, back massages to my husband who has dementia for several months. Initially for 10 to 15 minutes, now increased to 45. He loves it. He becomes relaxed and mellow, and always looks forward to his treatments and chats with Kelly. I am very grateful for the pleasure and help she gives him, unwaveringly friendly, and coping admirably with a sometimes challenging client.
